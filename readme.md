# CS:GO Storage Container Loader
csgo-storage-container is an open source CLI interface that aims to make it easier (and faster) to load and unload Storage Containers.

This application is using Nodejs and requires a little bit of setup that you might be unfamiliar with if you are not a programmer. I will do my best to explain every step clearly, to make this tool accessible to as many users as possible. If you have Node.js 14.0.0 or higher installed and know how to start a node application, you can just download this repo and start the application. For everyone else, here is a little explainer:



# Setup
Install [Node.js](nodejs.org) Version 14.0.0 or higher

install git

Download this application using

```console
git clone https://github.com/NicholasThierolf/csgo-storage-container
```

# usage
Start the application opening the console in the csgo-storage-container folder and typing:
```console
node index.js
```

You will be asked to provide your Steam Login credentials, and will be guided through the process of storing items.
